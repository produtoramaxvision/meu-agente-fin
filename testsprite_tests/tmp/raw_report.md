#### Test TC004
- **Test Name:** AI Agent WhatsApp Message Interpretation and Task Execution
- **Test Code:** [TC004_AI_Agent_WhatsApp_Message_Interpretation_and_Task_Execution.py](./TC004_AI_Agent_WhatsApp_Message_Interpretation_and_Task_Execution.py)
- **Test Error:** The task to verify AI sub-agents correctly interpret natural language inputs via WhatsApp was partially completed. Financial entry creation and ambiguous input handling were successfully tested within the application interface. However, direct WhatsApp messaging tests were blocked by browser compatibility issues preventing access to WhatsApp Web. Scheduling and marketing AI agent tests via WhatsApp could not be performed. Overall, the AI sub-agents show correct interpretation and error handling in the tested scenarios, but full end-to-end WhatsApp integration testing remains incomplete due to technical constraints.

Therefore, the task is not fully finished.
